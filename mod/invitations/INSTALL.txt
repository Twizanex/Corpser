Creates objects with sent data as metadata that can be viewed later by the person who sent the invitation.

Instructions:

Drop into mod directory, enable it in the admin planel and change settings:
- Email address (website email adress)
- Period of validity of invitations in days
- Permissions (who should be able to send invitations)
- Walledgarden
- Walledgarden exceptions

- disable the standalone walledgarden plugin to make the invitation register form accessible
